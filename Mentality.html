          We spend years in school learning facts and figures but the one thing
          we're never taught is how to live a fulfilled life. That's why we need
          The School of Life - a real organisation founded ten years ago by
          writer and philosopher Alain de Botton. The School of Life has one
          simple aim: to equip people with the tools to survive and thrive in
          the modern world. And the most important of these tools is emotional
          intelligence.The School of Life is nothing short of a crash course in
          emotional maturity. With all the trademark wit and elegance of Alain
          de Botton's other writings, and rooted in practical, achievable
          advice, it show us a path to the better lives we all want and deserve.

          Repairing the profound damage of early abuse, neglect and deprivation
          is as infinitely complex as the healing of any injury to the human
          organism. In this beautifully written work Ruth Cohn describes in
          spellbinding detail the multiple modalities and skills that a
          therapist needs to bring to the table to make this work possible. She
          demonstrates the need for a creative use and activation of all our
          senses, combined with patience, compassion, humility, and hard-earned
          self knowledge. This book provides clinicians and curious consumers
          with a roadmap to finding both a voice and a spine. A true guide to
          healing.

          changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your
          system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you
          don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for
          change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the
          level of your systems.

          For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare--poverty, prejudice, and
          physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through
          self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed
          himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a
          US Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes.
          The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL,
          Army Ranger, and Air Force tactical air controller, he went on to set
          records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to
          name him the Fittest (Real) Man in America.
